# About Us

We are a North Texas based Pok√©mon TCG team. We are both a social club and compete in local/regional events. We meet weekly to test new deck archetypes, prepare for our next big event or host our own mini tournaments.

## Our Logo

![Full Logo](./assets/full-logo.png)

Designed by Omar and Maverick. We play on the name "mechanics" which describes a way the cards interact with the game, like an Ace in a game of Blackjack can either be 1 or 11. Comeback mechanics are found in many trading card games and are `known combinations or single cards that assist players to turn a game around`. Combining this name and its implied visuals with a "punk rock" feel of cute skull made the whole logo come together.
