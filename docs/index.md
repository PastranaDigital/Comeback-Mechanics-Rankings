## What the site does

=== "Elo-based Leaderboard"

	Players and avatars are set up by the Admin, Omar Pastrana, behind the scenes. Players begin with a `1200` Elo score and rankings are established using the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). This system is commonly used in Chess and ESports.

	- A player's Elo rating increases if they win games, and decreases if they lose. 
	- A player's Elo rating also increases if they beat a higher-ranked player. 

	
=== "Match Result Entries"

	The winning player enters their results on the Ranked Match tab. This adjusts the ratings for each player involved in the match. This can be found in the History section.
